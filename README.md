# AI-Process-scheduler
An intelligent, machine learning-powered process scheduler that predicts and assigns CPU scheduling priorities based on real-time system usage. This project uses system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and the number of active processes to dynamically decide which processes should be prioritizedâ€”just like a smart OS scheduler!
